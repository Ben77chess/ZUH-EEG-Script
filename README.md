# ZUH-EEG-Script
Matlab script created for ZUH. As this is still a WIP, this code is not as of yet formatted for readability and is occasionally quite messy or ineffecient. Hopefully I will have a chance to remedy this soon.

The files I am responsible for writing are testConversion_v2 and figureGenerator. The other files are taken from other sources and used to facilitate those scripts, and are only occasionally modified by myself where marked. Other derivative works inside my 2 scripts are marked as well.
